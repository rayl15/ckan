Mo is a mustache template rendering software written in bash.  It inserts
environment variables into templates.

Simply put, mo will change {{VARIABLE}} into the value of that
environment variable.  You can use {{#VARIABLE}}content{{/VARIABLE}} to
conditionally display content or iterate over the values of an array.

Simple usage:

   mo [--false] [--help] [--source=FILE] filenames...

--false       - Treat the string "false" as empty for conditionals.
--help        - This message.
--source=FILE - Load FILE into the environment before processing templates.
